# AICourse

Artificial Intelligence with Machine Learning in Java, hosted by Oracle, coursework. Included is the certificate of completion, my course notes, my course plan, and the source code for the Yes/No game created in the course. The code is for review only, since it the only code included has been written by me and omits any libraries- So, a video of the game is has been included for demonstration purposes in the repository files.
